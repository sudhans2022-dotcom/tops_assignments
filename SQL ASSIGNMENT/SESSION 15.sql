--TASK 1-- Write an SQL query using the NOW() function to display the current date and time as 'CurrentDateTime' in your result set.

SELECT NOW() AS CurrentDateTime;

--TASK 2-- Suppose you have a table called Orders with a column order_date (DATE type). Write a query to display each order's order_date, the year, month, and day as separate columns using YEAR(), MONTH(), and DAY().

SELECT
    order_date,YEAR(order_date) AS order_year,
    MONTH(order_date) AS order_month,
    DAY(order_date) AS order_day
FROM Orders;

--TASK 3-- Imagine you are building a feature like Zomato's order delivery estimate. Given a table Deliveries with a column delivery_date, write a query to show delivery_date and a new column expected_pickup_date which is 2 days before delivery_date using DATE_SUB().

SELECT
    delivery_date,
    DATE_SUB(delivery_date, INTERVAL 2 DAY) AS expected_pickup_date
FROM Deliveries;

--TASK 4-- You have a table called Subscriptions with columns user_id, start_date, and end_date. Write a query to display user_id, start_date, end_date, and the total number of days of each subscription using DATEDIFF().<br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Use DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) to get the duration.</em>

SELECT
    user_id,
    start_date,
    end_date,
    DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) AS total_days
FROM Subscriptions;

--TASK 5-- Create an SQL query for a table named AppLogins (columns: user_id, last_login_date) to find all users who haven't logged in for more than 30 days from today. Use NOW() and DATEDIFF() in your query.<br><br><em><strong>Constraint:</strong> Only select user_id and last_login_date for users who meet the criteria.</em>

SELECT
    user_id,
    last_login_date
FROM AppLogins
WHERE DATEDIFF(NOW(), last_login_date) > 30;
